### _Translating complex systems into intuitive human experiences._

## 📌 Philosophy

# 

Documentation is the "Silent Support Agent." My goal is to empower users to solve problems independently, reducing support ticket volume and increasing product stickiness. I focus on:

*   **Actionability:** Every guide starts with a clear goal (The "Jobs-to-be-Done" framework).
    
*   **Visual Literacy:** Using annotated screenshots and diagrams to reduce cognitive load.
    
*   **Searchability:** Architecting content so users find answers in seconds, not minutes.

## 🛠 Documentation Talent Stack

# 

I treat documentation as a living product:

*   **Authoring:** Markdown, Docusaurus, Snagit (for annotations).
    
*   **System Thinking:** Explaining the _intent_ of a feature, not just the button location.
    
*   **Review Process:** Using GitHub PRs for collaborative technical accuracy checks.
    
*
